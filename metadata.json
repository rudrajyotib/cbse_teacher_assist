main source of energy on Earth Green plants can trap this energy and convert it into food:Plants also give out oxygen during photosynthesis which is used by animals to breathe:Thus,animals depend on plants for food and oxygen:Animals breathe out carbon dioxide which is used by plants to make food Thus,plants and animals are interdependent on each other:1.4 ADAPTATIONS IN PLANTS Natural home of a

Natural home of a plant is called its habitat Each habitat has its own characteristics,i.e,,some places are warm;some are hot,some are cold and some are very cold.Some places get a lot of rainfall while others are dry: Plants have special features to live successfully in their respective surroundings and have adjusted themselves to the different habitats o Earth e g, desert plants try to save whatever water is available and hence have adjusted well with low water conditions.This process of adjusting or changing to suit the environment is called adaptation.Adaptations in Terrestrial Plants

plenty of water: The soil is sticky and does not have enough air for the roots of the plants to breathe To withstand these problems, the trees growing in marshy areas have roots growing out of the water-logged soil to breathe air alongside normal, underground roots: Such roots are called breathing roots or pneumatophores Mangrove trees grow in marshes eg, sundari tree (a mangrove tree) found in

for their green colour due to chlorophyll and their self-dependence for food.However; there are certain plants which show different types of nutrition: Insectivorous Plants There are some plants which eat insects Such plants are known as insectivorous plants These plants are green and make their own food but they Some plants like dodder do not have in colour grow in soil which is poor in mineral (nitrogen).So, they trap and eat chlorophyll so they do not make their own insects to fulfil their nutrient requirement: Some examples food, instead absorb food from other living are sundew, Venus fly

from other living are sundew, Venus fly trap and pitcher plant.plants Such plants are called parasites In pitcher plant, the leaf is modified into a pitcher with a lid which can open and close.The pitcher is filled with a special nectar (digestive liquid).Whenever an insect comes to feed on this nectar and sits on the edge of the pitcher the lid closes and the insect is trapped inside.The insect gets digested from which the plant can obtain its mineral nutrition: Venus flytrap Pitcher plant The leaves of Venus flytrap are like boxes with hinges They have long hair along the edges.When an insect touches the hair; the leaf closes rapidly, trapping the insect inside.", " the plant can obtain its mineral nutrition: Venus flytrap Pitcher plant The leaves of Venus flytrap are like boxes
