Some places get a lot of rainfall while others are dry: Plants have special features to live successfully in their respective surroundings and have adjusted themselves to the different habitats o Earth e g, desert plants try to save whatever water is available and hence have adjusted well with low water conditions. This process of adjusting or changing to suit the environment is called adaptation.\nAdaptations in Terrestrial Plants Plants that grow on land are called terrestrial plants As there are different land forms like plains, hills, deserts, swamps, etc,, there are different types of plants growing in each of these habitats | Science 3\nPlants growing in the plains climate. It is neither too hot nor too cold: The Plains have a moderate The rainfall is just climate is warm to hot in summer and cold in winter: As the climate is well suited for plant growth, sufficient for plant growth: in the plains have lots of many kinds of plants grow here: Trees growing branches e & , neem; peepal, mango, banyan, etc: Most trees growing in plains usually shed their leaves in winter to themselves from the cold weather and get new leaves again protect maple, Banyan Such trees are called deciduous trees, e &, oak tree in spring: elm; apple etc.", "us trees, e &, oak tree in spring: elm; apple etc. shed their leaves and remain green throughout the year: Such trees Certain trees do not are called evergreen trees, e g, some varieties of neem plant: where it rains heavily, tall and thick trees (e &, teak, rubber; etc:) and some short In plains, home to trees lianas) grow: Such areas are called rainforests which are many and climbers (e.g , animals, Most rainforests are found in South America, Asid, Africa and Australia.\nMango tree\nPeepal tree\nSugarcane\nTeak\nPlants growing on hills The climate on hills and mountains is cold to very cold. During winter; there is snowfall in some areas. Therefore; the plants growing on hills are well adapted to such weather conditions.\nWoody cone\nNeedle like leaves Needle like leaves and cone of a pine tree\nPine tree\nof trees helps to slide off the snow easily: This helps to prevent damage to the plant Sloping shape and its parts due to extreme cold.", "t Sloping shape and its parts due to extreme cold. Leaves are needle shaped with waxy coating: This helps to prevent any damage from the snow These trees have woody cones instead of flowers That is why they are  called coniferous trees  The cones are very hard and bear seeds inside them e g, pine, spruce; cedar (such as deodar), fir; etc. Most of the conifers are evergreen trees eg, pine, spruce and some conifers are deciduous trees eg, larch Cedar Spruce\nPlants growing in deserts Climate in deserts is hot, = dry and dusty:  of water Inspite of all these There is shortage disadvantages, deserts with certain plants grow Desert Oak, found in Australia has roots that in special features. are 30 times longer than its trunk The roots go Certain plants, like Acacia or babool (also called kikar) have small = very deep into the ground to reach water;  This leaves to prevent water loss through water is then stored in the trunk: When there transpiration; Transpiration is the process of losing is no water in the desert, local people put thin water in the form of vapour through the leaves. stomata of pipes into the trunk of this tree; to drink water: Some plants, such as date palms, have and deserts.", "Some plants, such as date palms, have and deserts. strong dry and hard leaves which help them to survive in hot\nAcacia tree Date palm Cactus Certain plants, like mesquite tree, have roots that go down up to 20 metres under the ground in search of water  Certain plants, like cactus, have leaves modified into spines that help in preventing In some desert plants; the stomata are found deep into water loss through stomata. These spines the leaves rather than on the surface of the leaves discourage animals from eating them. The Hence; they are called sunken stomata.", "g them. The Hence; they are called sunken stomata. This reduces green stem stores water and carries out water loss through stomata: photosynthesis.\nPlants growing in swamps or marshes Marshes have clayey soil with plenty of water: The soil is sticky and does not have enough air for the roots of the plants to breathe To withstand these problems, the trees growing in marshy areas have roots growing out of the water-logged soil to breathe air alongside normal, underground roots: Such roots are called breathing roots or pneumatophores  Mangrove trees grow in marshes eg, sundari tree (a mangrove tree) found in Sundarbans\nPlants growing in sea coasts Mangrove tree The coastal areas have hot and wet climate; Trees growing in coastal areas should be able to withstand salty water; strong winds and heavy rainfall.\nCoconut tree\nPepper plant\nScience\n5\nstraight: They have a crown of giant, feather-like The trees growing here are usually tall znd to grow well in salty water; Their They are adepted COconoity; pepper: fruits Ieaves which allow the wind to pass through: examples are trees and seeds are scattered by water: Some Adaptations in Aquatic Plants lakes, seas, oceans) are called aquatic plants.", "ts lakes, seas, oceans) are called aquatic plants.

They are small and light in weight: Some examples are duckweed (Wolfia), water lettuce (Pistia) and water hyacinth\nDuckweed\nWater hyacinth\nUnderwater plants Some plants like Hydrilla and tape grass remain completely submerged in water: So, they are called underwater or submerged plants\nHydrilla\nTape grass\nThese plants have thin and narrow leaves with flexible stems to withstand water currents. Hydrilla has tiny leaves and the leaves of tape grass are ribbon-like Their roots are fixed to the bottom of the pond. The leaves of underwater plants have no stomata at all. They breathe the dissolved oxygen through their body surface.\n6\n1.5 UNUSUAL PLANTS Plants are primarily known for their green colour due to chlorophyll and their self-dependence for food. However; there are certain plants which show different types of nutrition: Insectivorous Plants There are some plants which eat insects  Such plants are  known as insectivorous plants  These plants are green and make their own food but they Some  plants like  dodder  do not have in colour grow in soil which is poor in mineral (nitrogen). So, they trap and eat chlorophyll so they do not make their own insects to fulfil their nutrient requirement: Some examples food, instead absorb food from other living are sundew, Venus fly trap and pitcher plant.", "ving are sundew, Venus fly trap and pitcher plant. plants Such plants are called parasites In pitcher plant, the leaf is modified into a pitcher with a lid which can open and close. The pitcher is filled with a special nectar (digestive liquid). Whenever an insect comes to feed on this nectar and sits on the edge of the pitcher the lid closes and the insect is trapped inside. The insect gets digested from which the plant can obtain its mineral nutrition:\nVenus flytrap\nPitcher plant\nThe leaves of Venus flytrap are like boxes with hinges They have long hair along the edges. When an insect touches the hair; the leaf closes rapidly, trapping the insect inside. The insect gets gradually digested, 1.6 FUNGI Fungi are organisms that cannot make their own food by photosynthesis as they do nothave chlorophyll. They absorb nutrients from dead and decaying plants, animals or stale food. They are also called saprophytes.\n| Science\n1\nMoulds and mushrooms are some examples of fungi:\nSometimes   bread slices change colour when keep them for longer time at room temperature, Vou is because of the growth of moulds on them This\nMushroom\n1.7 USES OF PLANTS produce food in the form of fruits, vegetables, pulses, producers.", "the form of fruits, vegetables, pulses, producers.

A cuttle fish has an ink sac on its body: When it senses danger; it releases ink from the ink sac, the water blue: The enemy cannot see anything for some time and cuttle fish escapes. making` Some animals pretend to be dead when they are in danger eg,, certain snakes A puffer fish can blow itself upto twice its normal size, so that it looks bigger and scares enemies. away its\n2.3 REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS The process by which living beings produce their young ones is called reproduction. It is the process by which new living beings are produced which resemble their parents. Animals reproduce so that life on Earth can continue: Animals can be categorised based on how they reproduce.", "ls can be categorised based on how they reproduce. All animals grow into adults: The sequential stages of development that occur in life of an organism starting from egg O young one to a mature adult are termed as the life cycle of that animal Animals\nEgg-laying\nBirth-giving\nEg\" lion, dog,' cat; man, etc.\nEg; hen, snake, etc,\nEgg-laying Animals Hence, they are called as Birds, fish, insects, snakes, frogs, etc. are some of the animals that Jay eggs. egg-laying animals: Birds Most birds build nests on trees to Jay eggs and raise their babies After laying eggs, the mother Adult hen bird keeps the eggs warm by sitting on them. This Egg is called incubation. When baby bird develops Baby chick fully; it breaks open the egg shell and comes out, hatches out this process is called as hatching: Mother hen WatMS the eg8 The baby birds grow into adults. The parent birds feed and protect the young ones until they can look after themselves; Life cycle of a hen An egg of a hen is oval in shape and has a thin protective shell called the egg shell. An air space is present at the broad end of the egg: The air Egg shell - Yolk space grows larger as an egg ages. An egg has a Embryo white jelly-like substance inside called albumen Air space- which protects the embryo.", "lled albumen Air space- which protects the embryo. The yellow inner Albumen yolk; Yolk provides food part of the egg is called for the growing baby or embryo. The embryo chick, Albumen is rich in water Parts of an egg develops into a and proteins whereas Yolk is rich in fats.\nFish Fish Jay' thousands of eggs at a time in water: Fish eggs do not have have a jelly around them to protect them from water; shells: They Only few eggs grow into adult fish as many are also eaten away by predators.
